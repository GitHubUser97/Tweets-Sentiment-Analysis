This project is a ‘Tweets Sentiment Analysis’ project. The objective, in this project, is classifying with good accuracy the polarity of tweets either as ‘Positive’, ‘Negative’, and ‘Neutral’. In this report, we are presenting the classification model we built in order to reach this objective. There are a lot of papers in the literature addressing the problem of ‘Tweet Sentiment Analysis’, a lot of papers presented multiple processing techniques and features that can be used in the classification problem. We used some external papers beside the paper provided in the project to help us in understanding the problem, and approaching it. We used many techniques, features and algorithms to help us in building an effective classification model. We tested a lot of classification models using various combinations of techniques and features, and at the end we succeeded in building a model that is able to classify the polarity of the tweets with good accuracy.

These datasets are originally provided by the “International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval)” on 2013, 2015, and 2016 [4]. We merged the three datasets to be used in our model as one training dataset. Each dataset consist of three main parts: tweet id, tweet polarity, and tweet. The polarity is either positive, negative or neutral.
